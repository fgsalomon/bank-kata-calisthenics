# Bank Kata

Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they hired both of you for a greenfield project in your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-full and your new-age programming language can cope with good oleâ€™ COBOL!

## Requirements

Write a class `Account` that offers the following methods:

* `void deposit(int)`
* `void withdraw(int)`
* `String printStatement()`

An example statement would be:

```bash
Date        Amount  Balance
24.12.2015   +500      500
23.8.2016    -100      400
```
